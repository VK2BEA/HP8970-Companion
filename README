------------------------------------------------------------------

Program to augment functionality of the HP 8970 Noise Figure Meter.
    1. Control the 8970 vis GPIB to take measurements of noise figure and gain over a frequency sweep or over time.
    2. Plot the noise figure/temperature and gain vs frequency
       Use mouse to examine the trace (interrogate plot to see measurements and interpolated values)
    3. Save traces as an image file (PNG) or PDF.
    4. Save measured data as CSV for further processing or as a JSON file to be retrieved at a later time.
    4. Print traces to connected printer
